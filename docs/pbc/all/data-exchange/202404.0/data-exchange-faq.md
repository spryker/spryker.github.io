**What is the difference between Backend API and Data Exchange API?**

The difference between Backend API and Data Exchange API lies in their functionalities:

- The Backend API consists of resource/route-based development-driven API endpoints that serve a specific business logic purpose, such as calculating order totals or managing PIM data.
- In contrast, the Data Exchange API is a REST API abstraction layer over our database tables, offering secure and convenient access to our data model with enhanced performance. It's managed through UI or configuration files without requiring development efforts.
