# Spryker Monitoring Integration
The Spryker Monitoring Integration is a comprehensive product capability designed to empower customers with advanced monitoring for their applications and systems. Leveraging [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), this solution enables seamless connectivity and forwarding of telemetry data, including traces and health status metrics, to OpenTelemetry-compatible monitoring platforms. This integration facilitates near real-time tracking of application performance and monitoring of system health status.

## What is OpenTelemetry (OTel)
OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework that provides APIs, libraries, and agents for collecting traces and metrics across various applications. It standardizes the instrumentation of software to help developers monitor and improve application performance effectively. OTel allows to provide a seamless and vendor-agnostic monitoring experience, empowering customers to integrate Spryker with their preferred APM solutions while adhering to industry best practices for collecting and analyzing performance data.

## Telemetry data in scope of Spryker Monitoring Integration
The Spryker Monitoring Integration focuses on several key entities to provide comprehensive monitoring:

### Traces and Spans
> [!NOTE]
> Supported Version of OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions is 1.30.0

In OpenTelemetry, a **trace** represents the journey of a single request or transaction as it moves through various components of a system, capturing the end-to-end flow. A **span** is a single operation or unit of work within a trace, containing information like the operation name, start and end times, and any relevant metadata. Together, traces and spans provide a detailed view of the interactions and performance of different parts of an application, helping to diagnose issues and optimize performance.

### Health Status Metrics
Via Spryker Monitoring Integration our customers have access to a set of service health metrics. These metrics provide a high-level view into the health status of enabled services such us database, message broker, scheduler and application services. The level of detail is as follows.

> [!NOTE]
> Labels/Dimensions/Attributes in relation to metrics are used interchangeably. The terminology depends on the customer's solution choice. For example in Grafana, we would use the term labels, while in Dynatrace, we use dimensions, etc.

#### Metrics Without Dimensions
The following metrics return a gauge with a binary value: 1 (Green) or 0 (Red). They are composites of multiple service-related signals that, after transformations and calculations, yield a single value indicating the service's health.

```yaml
hc_rds: Reports 0 or 1 for the overall health of the RDS Service.
hc_jenkins: Reports 0 or 1 for the overall health of the Jenkins Service.
hc_rabbitmq: Reports 0 or 1 for RabbitMQ health.
```

#### Metrics with Dimensions
These metrics can be split by the following dimensions/labels*:
```yaml
hc_rabbitmq_message_count_sum: A count of RabbitMQ messages [dimension_queue, dimension_virtualhost].
hc_jenkins_builds_success_build_count_total.count: A count of successful Jenkins jobs [jenkins_job].
hc_jenkins_builds_failed_build_count_total.count: A count of failed Jenkins jobs [jenkins_job].
hc_tasks_cpu_average: CPU utilization in % for cluster tasks [dimension_clustername, dimension_servicename].
hc_tasks_memory_utilization: Memory utilization in % for cluster tasks [dimension_clustername, dimension_servicename].
```
#### Metric Details
The default metrics resolution is 60 seconds. All metrics can be split by telemetry-data-account.

## How do I get it?
### Prerequisites
- Customers need to have an OpenTelemetry-compatible APM tool, which can be selected from the list of [supported vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/). <br>
- Customers need to be eligible for Spryker Monitoring Integration.

### How to activate Spryker Monitoring Integration
To request the Spryker Monitoring Integration, customers need to submit a Change Request through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com/). Follow these steps:

- Submit a Change Request: Access the Support Portal and create a new Change Request.
- Provide the following Information:
  - Endpoint: The endpoint URL of your APM tool.
  - Token: An API token that Spryker can use to configure and communicate with your APM tool.

Spryker Support will guide you through the setup process once the request is submitted.

### Instrumenting Your Application
To send telemetry data to your APM tool, your application must be instrumented using OpenTelemetry. This process ensures that the necessary data is collected and forwarded to the monitoring system of your choice.
Customers can self-serve the instrumentation by following the [instrumentation guide](/docs/ca/dev/opentelemetry/how-to-instrument.md#integration), but Spryker also offers expert services to assist with this setup. If you require professional support, please contact your sales representative for further assistance.

> [!NOTE]
>This solution only supports the **OpenTelemetry Collector** for telemetry ingestion. **Proprietary vendor agents (e.g., Dynatrace, DataDog, or New Relic agents) are not supported**. Instead, these platforms ingest telemetry streamed through the OpenTelemetry Collector, ensuring flexibility, interoperability, and vendor neutrality while adhering to industry-standard observability practices. As a consequence of the OpenTelemetry activation, any previously installed proprietary agent will be removed.
